This work was produced under contract to the Australian National Phenome
Centre, Murdoch University.

## Purpose

This repository contains ChemInfo cells and other JavaScript scripts for
editing a PathBank "Simple SVG" of a particular pathway.  This is mainly for
the purposes of version control and demonstration.

The main requirements are that a PathBank pathway simple SVG must be able to be
sourced or otherwise uploaded by the user, and the appearance edited with
respect to a specific input TSV.
